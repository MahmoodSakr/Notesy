'''
Note how we never defined a __init__ constructor method on the User class? 
Thatâ€™s because SQLAlchemy adds an implicit constructor to all model classes which 
accepts keyword arguments for all its columns and relationships.

If you decide to override that implicit constructor for any reason, make sure to keep 
to make it accepting **kwargs and call the super constructor with those **kwargs as following

class Table(db.Model):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(Table, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        # do custom stuff
